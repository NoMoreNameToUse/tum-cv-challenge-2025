# TUM CV Challenge SoSe 2025 â€“ GeoVision

## Description

This branch contains the submission code from **Team 25** for the **Satellite Image Comparison Challenge**, part of the **Computer Vision (EI70110)** course (SoSe 2025) offered by the Chair of Data Processing at the **Technical University of Munich**.

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone -b gui-playground https://github.com/NoMoreNameToUse/tum-cv-challenge-2025.git
```

### 2. Running the GUI
 
* Open run_cv_app.m in MATLAB.
* Run the script. The GUI should launch shortly.

The GUI should work on both windows and macos and is tested to work from version MATLAB R2024b upwards

## GUI Feature Overview
![Dashboard Main GUI](docs/documentation/IMG/dashboardMainGUI.png)

Main view of the GUI, displaying all the necessary information

### Basic Functions

![Import Dataset](docs/documentation/IMG/dashboardImportGUI.png)

First, import your dataset by selecting its folder, and wait for the GUI to finish processing the dataset.

![Select Dataset Start / End](docs/documentation/IMG/dashboardSelectStartEndGUI.png)

Second, select the part of your dataset to be analyzed by either using the range selection or the file tree in the sidebar.

You can preview the original, aligned or cropped images by using the preview settings, and switch between images by using the dropdown, quick select or filetree. 

After this, you can start to visualize the change by selecting a visualization method from the top selection tabs. 

### Sidebar Functions 
![Individual Image / Dataset Select](docs/documentation/IMG/dashboardSelectTreeGUI.png)

Filetree tab: You can include / exclude images from the dataset or switch dataset here. It can also be used as quick navigation for previewing.

![GUI Settings](docs/documentation/IMG/dashboardSelectSettingsGUI.png)

Settings for the GUI. Self explanatory.
